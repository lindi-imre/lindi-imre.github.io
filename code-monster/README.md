#### Code Monster from Crunchzilla

Code Monster from Crunchzilla is an interactive programming tutorial
for kids that focuses on action. Code changes immediately yield
visible results.

Code Monster from Crunchzilla is publicly available to play for free
at

http://www.crunchzilla.com/

Projects start with simple boxes and colors, rapidly progressing into
exciting experiments with simple animation and fractals. Important
programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, expressions,
and functions are introduced by example.

Code Monster is a gentle and fun introduction to programming
concepts. It is a first step in learning to program.

We decided to make a version of code for the tutorial itself available for
others to modify, use, and translate.

If you want to create your own lessons or translate the existing
lessons to a language other than English, the lesson content is
entirely contained in codemonster-lessons.js in a large JSON
file. Changing just that file will allow you to create your own lesson
content. If you want to change or translate the help menus or title,
edit the index.html file.

To deploy your modified code to your own webserver, just upload all
the files to your favorite host. The code only contacts the server
once at initialization to download all the lessons (intentionally,
allowing people to play offline if they want to). You don't need any
special configuration; just upload all the files like this was a web
page.

If you build anything using the code for Code Monster from
Crunchzilla, it'd be nice to credit Crunchzilla.com for the original
code, though you don't have to.  If you want to show off anything you
build using this code, we'd love to hear from you
(contact@crunchzilla.com).
